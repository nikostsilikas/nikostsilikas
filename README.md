# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ !

I'm Nick, a graduate student specializing in Biostatistics and Health Data Science at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, where I also earned my BSc in Biology.

My academic and research interests span a variety of fields, particularly in the application of machine learning to epidemiological research, clinical trials, and -omics methodologies.
